# XT.COM: How About It? XT.COM Introduction and Review

## XT.COM Introduction

XT.COM is a cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2018 and headquartered in Dubai. The platform supports over 530 different cryptocurrencies and offers various services, including spot trading, contract trading, and copy trading. Despite its rapid transaction speed and lack of slippage in market and limit orders, XT.COM faces criticism for high transaction fees and limited security features. Its lack of governmental regulation and reserve transparency has raised concerns, but XT.COM has not experienced any major security breaches.

## XT.COM Reviews

XT.COM offers decent transaction speeds and liquidity, but the exchange is criticized for its high fees and poor security infrastructure. Users have reported a lack of real-time balance verification and ineffective customer support. Nevertheless, XT.COM remains operational without major incidents. The absence of regulatory oversight and sufficient reserve transparency may leave users feeling uncertain about its long-term reliability.
